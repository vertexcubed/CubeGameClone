# CubeGameClone

This is a simple voxel engine implemented entirely in Rust using the [Bevy](https://bevy.org/) framework. Currently, it features infinite flat chunk generation, and the ability to place and break blocks. 
All blocks are entirely data driven, meaning new ones can be added by simply creating a text file. In the future, this will be expanded into a full scale 3D automation game inspired by Factorio and GregTech.
